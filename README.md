# Hand-Gesture-Mouse-Interface
Hand Gesture Mouse Interface is developed to captures hand gesture from the user through web camera to perform the corresponding operation on the computer device.

## Inspired from
Gesture recognition is a topic in computer science with the goal of interpreting human gestures via mathematical algorithms.It is a subdiscipline of computer vision.

Gesture recognition can be seen as a way for computers to begin to understand human body language, thus building a richer bridge between machines and humans than primitive text user interfaces or even GUIs (graphical user interfaces), which still limit the majority of input to keyboard and mouse and interact naturally without any mechanical devices. Using the concept of gesture recognition, it is possible to point a finger at this point will move accordingly. This could make conventional input on devices such and even redundant.

-> So this project is our approach to fulfil the objective.

## A step towards Touchless interface
Here the Touchless user interface(TUI) comes into picture.
* Touchless user interface is an emerging type of technology in relation to gesture control.
* TUI is the process of commanding the computer via body motion and gestures without touching a keyboard, mouse, or screen.
* Touchless interface in addition to gesture controls are becoming widely popular as they provide the abilities to interact with devices without physically touching them.
